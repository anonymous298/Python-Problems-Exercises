on building machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human 
intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. AI technologies can analyze large volumes of data from various sources and use it to assist in business operations effectively. AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, which are transforming virtually every industry and becoming an increasingly integral part of everyday life.Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can 
understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can 
act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention 
(a classic example being a self-driving car).Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. Each of these 
approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.But one of the most 
popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a neural network (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and 
function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well 
suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data.The simplest form of machine learning is called supervised learning, which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data.Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.Deep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers.These multiple layers enable unsupervised learning: 
they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents.Because deep 
learning doesn’t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a 
tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP), computer 
vision, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.Semi-supervised learning, which combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train AI models for classification and regression tasks.Self-supervised learning, which generates implicit labels from unstructured data, rather than relying on labeled data sets for supervisory signals.Reinforcement learning, which learns by trial-and-error and reward functions rather than by extracting information from hidden patterns.Transfer learning, in which knowledge gained through one task or data set is used to improve model performance on another related task or different data set.Generative AI, sometimes called "gen AI", refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content—such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more—in response to a user’s prompt or request.At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s 
similar, but not identical, to the original data.Generative models have been used 
for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they 
evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided 
with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types:Variational 
autoencoders or VAEs, which were introduced in 2013, and enabled models that could 
generate multiple variations of content in response to a prompt or instruction.
Diffusion models, first seen in 2014, which add "noise" to images until they are unrecognizable, and then remove the noise to generate original images in response 
to prompts.Transformers (also called transformer models), which are trained on 
sequenced data to generate extended sequences of content (such as words in sentences, 
shapes in an image, frames of a video or commands in software code). Transformers are at the core of most of today’s headline-making generative AI tools, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, Copilot, BERT, Bard and Midjourney.In general, generative AI operates in three phases:

Training, to create a foundation model.
Tuning, to adapt the model to a specific application.
Generation, evaluation and more tuning, to improve accuracy.
Training
Generative AI begins with a "foundation model"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications.

The most common foundation models today are large language models (LLMs), created for text generation applications. But there are also foundation models for image, video, sound or music generation, and multimodal foundation models that support several kinds of content.

To create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of relevant raw, unstructured, unlabeled data, such as terabytes or petabytes of data text or images or video from the internet. The training yields a neural network of billions of parameters—encoded representations of the entities, patterns and relationships in the data—that can generate content autonomously in response to prompts. This is the foundation model.

This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs.

Tuning
Next, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in various ways, including:

Fine-tuning, which involves feeding the model application-specific labeled data—questions or prompts the application is likely to receive, and corresponding correct answers in the wanted format.

Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), in which human users evaluate the accuracy or relevance of model outputs so that the model can improve itself. This can be as simple as having people type or talk back corrections to a chatbot or virtual assistant.
Generation, evaluation and more tuning
Developers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model—even as often as once a week—for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months.

Another option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance.

Benefits of AI 
AI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include:

Automation of repetitive tasks.
More and faster insight from data.
Enhanced decision-making.
Fewer human errors.
24x7 availability.
Reduced physical risks.
Automation of repetitive tasks
AI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks—including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work.

Enhanced decision-making
Whether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, data-driven decisions. Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention.

Fewer human errors
AI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision.

Machine learning algorithms can continually improve their accuracy and further reduce errors as they're exposed to more data and "learn" from experience.

Round-the-clock availability and consistency
AI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications—such as materials processing or production lines—AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks.

Reduced physical risk
By automating dangerous work—such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space—AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers.
AI use cases 
The real-world applications of AI are many. Here is just a small sampling of use cases across various industries to illustrate its potential:
Customer experience, service and support
Companies can implement AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, support tickets and more. These tools use natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI capabilities to understand and respond to customer questions about order status, product details and return policies.
Chatbots and virtual assistants enable always-on support, provide faster answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), free human agents to focus on higher-level tasks, and give customers faster, more consistent service.
